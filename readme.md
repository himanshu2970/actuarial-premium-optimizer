# Machine Learning Workflow

## Steps to be Performed

### 1. Data Collection
Websites which can be used for Data Gathering:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
- [US Census](https://www.census.gov/)
- [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
- [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

**Features which are expected:**

**Default Features**
- Age  
- Region  
- BMI  
- Children  
- Smoker  

**Use-case Specific Features**
- Feature - 1  

---

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Normalization of Data  
- Handling Missing Values  
- Handling Outliers  

---

### 3. Data Exploration
1. Familiarize with the data  
2. Get Statistical Analysis using Python  
3. Extract Insights by:
   - Creating Graphs  
   - Creating E-R Diagrams  

---

### 4. Feature Selection
- Apply Clustering/ML Algorithms:  
  - KNN (⚠️ not good with outliers)  
  - XGBoost  
  - AdaBoost  

**Points to consider:**
- Select only meaningful features  
- Remove redundant/irrelevant features  

---

### 5. Model Training
1. Select multiple models and train with your dataset  
2. Improve accuracy using:
   - Bagging  
   - Boosting  

---

### 6. Outsourced Data
- Fine-tune external datasets (from GitHub or other sources) before training  

### 7. Own Model
- Select all required libraries and components  
- Ensure accuracy through experimentation and evaluation  

---

### 8. Model Deployment
- Deploy trained model into production environment  
- Monitor and retrain as needed
